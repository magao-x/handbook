   CIC
      Clock-induced charge. A type of shot noise caused by clocking behavior in CCDs, of more concern when electron-multiplying.
      Also known as "spurious charge". See Janesick's *Scientific Charge-coupled Devices*, 7.1.2.

   RON
      Read-out noise. Noise inherent in the process of converting photoelectrons
      in a pixel to digital counts. Independent of signal level
      dependent on ADC and amplifier electronics and temperature.
      See Howell's *Handbook of CCD Astronomy*, 3.4.

   shmim
      Shared-memory image. The unifying abstraction of CACAO inter-process communication,
      essentially a block of computer memory and a way to coordinate updates with other
      processes in the system.

   FDPR
      Focus diversity phase retrieval

   NCPA
      Non-common-path aberration

   NCPC
      Non-common-path correction

   ROI
      Region-of-interest, a.k.a. subframe--when you read out a region of a detector instead of the whole thing
