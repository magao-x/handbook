Acknowledgements
===========================
If your paper includes data obtained using MagAO-X (whether on-sky or in the lab) please include the following acknowledgements:

    We are very grateful for support from the NSF MRI Award #1625441. The Phase II upgrade
    program is made possible by the generous support of the Heising-Simons Foundation.  The
    development of CACAO is supported by NSF Award #2410616.

For papers that include on-sky data, please follow `these guidelines <https://carnegiescience.edu/instrumentation/our-telescopes/magellan/magellan-attribution>`_ :

 - The title should have a footnote that says "This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile."
 - It is also useful for the words "Magellan" and "Campanas" both to appear in the abstract. This helps with database searches.
