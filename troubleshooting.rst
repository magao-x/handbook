Figuring out what exactly isn’t working
---------------------------------------

To narrow down the failing component, use ``xctrl status`` to see if any
MagAO-X apps are not running. The typical MagAO-X app is started by
``xctrl startup`` based on a line in a config file in
``/opt/MagAOX/config/proclist_$MAGAOX_ROLE.txt``. This proclist
determines which application to start and which config file from
``/opt/MagAOX/config`` should be supplied as the ``-n`` option (see
:doc:`Standard options <operating/software/apps/overview>`). It also
uses ``sudo`` to run the process as user ``xsup``, regardless of which
user called ``xctrl startup``.

Many, if not all, MagAO-X apps are intended to run “forever” (i.e until
shutdown). If the process is ``dead``, you can attach to the ``tmux``
session that’s the parent of the process in question with
``xctrl inspect PROCNAME`` (where ``PROCNAME`` is the name of the failed
process). This will occasionally reveal error messages that did not get
to the log.

For example, if ``trippLitePDU`` is started by ``xctrl startup`` with
config specified by ``-n pdu0`` and there’s a syntax error in
``/opt/MagAOX/config/pdu0.conf`` preventing startup, you can attach to
the tmux session with

.. code-block:: bash

   yourlogin$ xctrl inspect pdu0

The errors before exit, if any, will be in the log. The last few lines
of the log can be checked with ``logdump -f pdu0``. The command that
started the app will be of the form
``/opt/MagAOX/bin/$appName -n $configName``. You can use the up-arrow
key in the tmux session to retrieve it from the shell history and try to
relaunch once you’ve corrected whatever error was preventing startup.

Addressing specific issues
--------------------------

Shared memory image problems with “No space left on device” errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When starting MagAO-X apps or CACAO apps that use shared memory images,
the ImageStreamIO library will try to create shared memory images on
``/milk/shm``. This can fail with an error like:

::

   ERROR [ FILE: /opt/MagAOX/source/cacao/src/ImageStreamIO/ImageStreamIO.c   FUNCTION: ImageStreamIO_createIm_gpu   LINE: 521 ]
   C Error: No space left on device

Indeed, if you use ``df -h``, you’ll see that ``/milk/shm`` is full:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ df -h
   Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
   [...]
   tmpfs            63G   63G     0 100% /milk/shm
   [...]

The solution is to :doc:`shut down <operating/shutdown>` and then clear
``/milk/shm``.

.. code-block:: bash

   you$ xsupify
   xsup$ cd /milk/shm
   xsup$ rm *

If rerunning ``df -h`` *still* doesn’t show any space available,
something is probably holding a reference to the files. (See `this
SuperUser
question <https://superuser.com/questions/1100059/tmpfs-deleting-files-wont-free-the-space>`__.)
You should reboot the computer with ``sudo reboot`` (having already shut
down / rested any hardware).

Loop failing to close for no apparent reason and/or intermittent failures of CACAO calibration process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Believe it or not, this can be a sign of insufficient disk space.
Consult ``df -h`` and see if any of the filesystems have ``Use%`` of
100%.

.. _missing_gpu:

Lockup / Missing GPUs / ``nvidia-smi`` errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our computers with PCIe expansion cards will occassionally lock up, or will lose a GPU (``GPU has fallen off
the bus`` errors). Sometimes running ``nvidia-smi`` fails with ``Unable to determine the device handle for GPU 0000:8C:00.0: GPU is lost.  Reboot the system to recover this GPU.`` GPU telemetry will also disappear from the monitoring dashboard.

1. If the system is responding:

   1. If you were using the system, rest any attached hardware and begin camera warmup. (You don't have to wait for them to reach the warmup temperature.) (For RTC: woofer, tweeter, ttmmod, ttmpupil, and camwfs.)

   2. Shutdown (requires sudo)

      .. code-block:: bash

         [user@exaoN ~]$ sudo shutdown -h now

   3. Now "press the power button" using the Moxa IO unit (see the ICC or RTC Power-On section for that computer in the :doc:`System Power On <operating/startup>` procedure)

2. If the system is not responding, GPUs continue to fall off the bus, or ``nvidia-smi`` errors persist after
   following the procedure above:

   1. If you can, perform steps 1.1 and 1.2 above to bring the system down in an orderly fashion.
   2. Power down ``pdu0.comprtc`` or ``pdu.compicc`` (e.g. with ``pwrGUI``)
   3. Wait at least 10 seconds.
   4. Now perform all of the ICC or RTC Power-On steps from the :doc:`System Power On <operating/startup>` procedure.

OCAM connectivity / bad data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OCAM connects over two CameraLink connections. CameraLink #1 carries
serial communication with the detector, so if you’re able to command the
camera but your data appear bad in ``rtimv camwfs``, the culprit is
likely the CameraLink #2 cable. Reseat, on ICC do
``xctrl restart camwfs``, and restart ``rtimv``.

Alpao DM not responding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure it has been initialized. There is an ``initialize_alpao``
systemd unit that runs at boot and initializes the interface card.
Successful execution looks like this in
``systemctl status initialize_alpao`` output:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ systemctl status initialize_alpao
   ● initialize_alpao.service - Initialize Alpao interface card
      Loaded: loaded (/opt/MagAOX/config/initialize_alpao.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)

The script is saved at ``/opt/MagAOX/config/initialize_alpao.sh``, if
you want to see what it’s doing. Note that executing it again will
appear to fail with a message about not finding cards to initialize if
the cards have been previously initialized.

DM Latency and Communication Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are various ways that the shared memory interprocess communication
between the deformable mirrors, loop control(s), and the hardware
control processes can stop functioning properly.

Examples with known fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Inability to set or zero flat or test from the dm control gui

   -  This likely points to a bad semaphore. Simply release DM, then
      re-initialize, and it usually clears. If not, go to more general
      steps below.

-  Excessive latency, occurs especially for ALPAOs

   -  This usually requires a power cycle of the driver itself. Release
      the DM, then use the power control GUI to turn off, then on the DM
      driver.

-  Skipped commands

   -  This is possibly caused by collisions on a semaphore, meaning more
      than one process is monitoring a given semaphore. This can be
      diagnosed with ``streamCTRL``. If this is not the case, a full
      software shutdown (both cacao and magao-x) and clearing the
      /milk/shm and /dev/shm directories (rm \*), then restarting,
      should clear the problem. See step 5 below.

General Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

General troubleshooting steps, in order of severity (try the lower ones
first if you don’t have a clear idea what the problem is): 1) release,
then initialize from the ``dmCtrl`` GUI 2) release, then restart the DM
controller software, e.g. for the woofer:

.. code-block:: bash

   rtc$ xctrl restart dmwoofer

1. restart the CACAO process that combines the DM shmims:

   -  first stop the DM controller (see above)
   -  restart ``dmcomb`` (or testbed equivalent) using ``fpsCTRL``

      -  run ``fpsCTRL``
      -  select process to restart with arrow keys
      -  hit lower-case ``r`` to stop the process
      -  hit upper-case ``R`` to start it again

   -  restart the DM controller (see above)

   Note: this may cause problems in some other processes due to shmim
   recreation.

2. Power cycle the DM

   -  release from the ``dmCtrl`` GUI
   -  turn off the power with the ``pwrCtrl`` GUI, then turn it back on
   -  if it doesn’t happen automatically, initialize the DM from the GUI
      when it has power
   -  if this does not fix the problem, try steps 1-3 again.

3. Full Software Restart

   -  Place all hardware controlled from this computer in a safe
      condition

      -  rest ``modttm`` and ``ttmpupil``
      -  start camera warmup (in case you can’t get software back up)
      -  release all DMs controlled from this computer

   -  Shutdown all software with:

      .. code-block:: bash

         rtc$ xctrl shutdown
         rtc$ tmux kill-server  # for cacao processes not managed by xctrl

   -  Clear all shared memory:

      .. code-block:: bash

          rtc$ cd /milk/shm
          rtc$ sudo rm *
          rtc$ cd /dev/shm
          rtc$ sudo rm *

   -  Now restart software and restore hardware to operating condition

4. Reboot

   -  This is a last resort. This may be necessary if a problem has
      developed in the device driver for instance.
   -  Follow procedure for computer reboot. Ensure all hardware is in a
      safe condition, including powered-off if needed, before rebooting.

EDT Framegrabber Problems (camwfs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EDT PCIe framegrabber occassionally stops responding. The main
symptom of this is no data from ``camwfs``, and no response on the
serial over camera link. 

If ``camwfs`` stops responding on serial (evident in logs, probably frame corruption), first
shutdown the controlling application.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ xctrl shutdown camwfs

You will next need to switch from user ``xsup`` to yourself:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ su <your-user-name>
   <password>

then do these steps to reload the EDT driver:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /opt/EDTpdv
   $ sudo ./edt_unload
   $ sudo ./edt_load

This will reset the kernel module and restore operation. Now return to ``xsup`` and restart the
controlling application:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ exit
   $ xctrl startup camwfs #<-change if a different camera

After this occurs, you will need to re-start the CACAO loop processes so they re-connect to the camwfs shmim.

Camsci1/2 not responding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``camsci1`` and/or ``camsci2`` stop responding, first attempt to restart the control software with ``xctrl restart``.  If this does not restore operation, the PICam library needs to be reset.  Perform the following steps:

1. Turn power off for both cameras.  Note that you will not be able to verify detector temperature but this can not be avoided.
2. Stop both ``camsci`` control processes.  Either use xctrl or go to the tmux session and use ctrl-c.
3. In a terminal on ICC, go to ``/opt/MagAOX/source/MagAOX/apps/picamCtrl`` and run the script ``cleanPI.sh`` as root.  This removes lock files.
4. Re-start both control processes.
5. Power up both cameras



Killing INDI zombies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ``indiserver`` crashes uncleanly (itself a subprocess of
`xindiserver <operating/software/apps/network.html#xindiserver>`_), the associated ``xindidriver`` processes may become
orphans (i.e. reparented to PID 1 (init)). This will prevent
`xindiserver <operating/software/apps/network.html#xindiserver>`_ from starting again until these processes have been
killed. (There will be output in logdump suggesting you
``kill the zombies``.)

``xctrl`` includes a built-in zombie hunter, and should do this for you.
Should you still be plagued by zombies, the manual version follows.

The following shell command will kill them:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ kill $(ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}' | grep MagAOX/drivers | awk '{print $1}')

To check if any remain use

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ps -elf | awk '{if ($5 == 1){print $4" "$5" "$15}}' | grep MagAOX/drivers


Difficulties with NVIDIA proprietary drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. When installing, ensure you have
   ``systemctl set-default multi-user.target`` and a display is
   connected **only** to the VGA header provided by the motherboard
2. If NVIDIA graphical output did work, and now doesn’t: Your kernel may
   have been updated, requiring a rebuild of the NVIDIA driver. Having
   ``dkms`` installed *should* prevent needing to do this, but an
   uninstall and reinstall over SSH will also remedy it.
3. Runfile installs can be uninstalled with
   ``/usr/local/cuda/bin/cuda-uninstaller``. This may leave a vestigial
   ``/usr/local/cudaXX.YY`` folder (where ``XX.YY`` is a version number)
   that can most likely be safely removed. (It's probably just some
   temporary files that the installer didn't create and is too polite
   to remove.)

Computer Fails to Boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There may be several reasons for this.  

Examples with known fixes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Startup screen frozen at "initalizing" and Q-Code A9

  - This probably means that the BIOS has lost its setup, and is trying to use a GPU for video display
  - Shutdown and fully power down. 
  - If you have a new mobo CR2032 battery, replace it now
  - Remove GPUs (i.e. by disconnecting the PCIe expansion cable from the host card on the mobo).
  - Install the VGA cable on the mobo (see manual for location)
  - Alternatively, you may be able to plug a monitor into the GPU
  - Boot, and press the del key over and over again until you see "Enter Setup" in the lower right corner.
  - Follow the BIOS setup guide
  - Reboot (F10, save settings).
  - Now shutdown, fully power down, and reinstall/reconnect all GPUS.
  - Reboot.
