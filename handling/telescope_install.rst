Initial Conditions
------------------

-  Instrument in LCO cleanroom on legs

Preparations
------------

-  If operating, shut down MagAO-X.

   - Make sure to leave stages/wheels in positions that are safe for transportation

       - See complete procedure in the :ref:`telescope removal procedure <tel_remove_shutdown>`

-  Prepare Legs for Move

    - Turn off table legs (table air power off, PEPS II rocker switch off) and remove air connection from wall
    - Lie under table and remove all three (#1,2,& 3) geophones from bottom of table
    - Place coiled up geophones and cables into basket
    - Unplug PEPS II power from side of rack
    - Remove the taped down exhaust line from the clean room floor

-  Remove all cables

   -  See detailed procedure for removing 2K DM cables

-  Electronics Rack

   -  Ensure that roll-out shelves are restrained
   -  If not installed, install side panels
   -  Close and lock doors
   -  Tape keys down

-  Instrument

   -  remove polarimeter
   -  install window cover
   -  Remove eyepiece
   -  Turn off blower, and remove hose
   -  Tape over any exposed holes (from cables, etc)
   -  Secure any loose cables
   -  Shrink wrap the instrument
   -  Install solar blanked over shrink wrap

-  Cart and Rigging

   -  Verify all cart hardware is in-hand
   -  Verify two wire harnesses are in hand
   -  Partially assemble cart, leaving one long side off
   -  Store cart out of the way so table can roll into unpacking area

-  Dome

   -  The NASE platform shoud be clear and ready for MagAO-X installation
   -  The dome jib crane should be set to "3 hairs" speed

-  XKID

   -  If XKID is pre-cooling on the platform:

      -  move the electronics to the dome floor
      -  move the dewar to the corner of the platform
      -  ensure cables are routed to minimize interference

Rig Onto Cart
-------------

-  Lower table legs onto the casters by turning the 16 leveling bolts,
   and remove the 12 metal pads

-  Roll the instrument out of the cleanroom

   **NOTE:** At least 4 people required, 2 to push, 2 to hold the
   cleanroom sides open.  Additional people are recommended to help guide.

   **CAUTION:** only push on the legs, not the table itself

-  Continue rolling the instrument through the garage door into the
   unpacking area

-  Move the cart, currently with 3 sides, around the legs

   **CAUTION:** be careful to not bump the legs with the cart

-  Attach the 4th side of the cart

-  Ensure that the 8 large bolts on the cart are snug but not tight


-  Attach the lifting wire-harness to each side of the cart.  The hooks should point outward.

-  Attach the load spreader with straight extensions to the crane,
   using a crane scale

   .. image:: figures/load_spreader_attach.jpg

   *The load spreader attached to the crane for lifting the cart*

-  Place the load spreader in the center position (the cart is
   symmetric)

-  Lift the load spreader, and position it over the instrument

-  Being careful to not bump the instrument, lower the load spreader
   and attach the lifting harness D rings. Use 4x shackles to extend the
   length to reach the cart on the floor.

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_extensions.jpg

   *Lifting harnesses attached with shackle extensions*

-  Position a person to hold each of the cart handles

   **CAUTION:** Do not allow the cart to bump the legs or the table
   uncontrolled

-  Slowly lift the cart (**320 lbs**) until it is touching the bottom
   of the table.

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_tofrom_table.jpg

   *The cart being lifted to the bottom of the table.  Note the direction of the hooks.*

-  Install the 4 outboard bolts. Loosen bolts
   on the cart as needed.

-  Once the cart is bolted to the table bottom, while **320 lbs** is
   still on the crane, tighten all cart bolts. Do not over-tighten, make
   1/4 turn after the washers are no longer free. This is to avoid
   excessive stress on the table.

-  Reposition the load spreader center to the instrument + cart
   position marked on it.

**CAUTION:** be sure that the load spreader does not hit the cart when
   being repositioned.

-  Install the triangle stabilizing ropes between the crane hook and
   the lifting fixture IAW the below figure. Tighten, but do not cause
   them to pick the load.

   .. image:: figures/stabilizers.jpg

   *The triangle stabilizing ropes should be tight, but not become the
   lifting point for the load.*

-  Ensure that there is room to move the legs out from under the
   table, opening the garage door into the cleanroom if necessary.

-  Position a person at each of the cart handles to stabilize it during
   the lift.

-  Position two people to remove the legs from under the table

-  Begin SLOWLY lifting the table off the legs. Once table is fully supported by the crane, the scale will read around 2000 lbs (as of March 2024).

-  Go up 0.5inch then stop and inspect the platters.  Use a long flathead screwdriver to very gently pry any stuck platters off bottom of table.

-  Move the legs out from under the table.

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_legs_ready.jpg

   *The cart and instrument ready to be set down on the wheels, with
   legs out of the way.*

-  Set the cart down on its wheels.

-  Re-check the cart bolts.  Tighten any that are loose to 1/4 turn past when the washers stop moving.

Transport MagAO-X To Clay
-------------------------

-  Move MagAO-X onto the lift gate (using plates over the gap)

-  Position a person at each corner of the instrument to stabilize it

-  Lift the instrument with cart until it will clear the legs

-  Move the legs under the instrument.

-  Ensure that the table pads are centered

-  While keeping the instrument level, very slowly lower it into
   position using the alignment pins.

-  If one side touches first platters will move and repeat last few steps until platters are centered and pins are centered

-  Once on the legs, unload the crane to the cart weight of **320
   lbs** and re-position the load spreader for the cart

   .. image:: figures/inst_platform_loadspreader.png

   *Adjusting the load spreader for the cart.*

-  With the crane supporting the cart weight, remove the 4
   bolts attaching the cart to the table

-  Lower the cart to the floor, and detach from the crane.

-  Stow the crane and handling gear

-  Remove the long side of the cart on the telescope side (4 bolts),
   and wheel the remaining pieces out from under table. Reassemble the
   cart and remove to the Aux. Bldg.

-  Conduct the daytime alignment procedure per alignment plan
