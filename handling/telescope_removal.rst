Initial Conditions
------------------

-  Instrument on Magellan Clay Nasmyth Platform, operating.

.. _tel_remove_shutdown:

Shutdown
------------

-  At the end of the last night, have the TO position the telescope so that the NASE platform faces the elevator.

-  Power down all of MagAO-X

   - Ensure that `stagepickoff` in the `out` position.
   - Place the k-mirror at 0 degrees.
   - Select the Ha-narrow and CH4-875 filters on fwsci1/2
   - turn off power for all devices on MagAO-X following the regular shutdown procedure.
   - use the `shutdown -h now` command to halt both RTC and ICC
   - once the computers are off, turn off all things in the rack.


-  Remove blower hose and cover the hole.

-  Remove all cables

   -  See detailed procedure for removing 2K DM cables

-  Electronics Rack

   -  Ensure that roll-out shelves are restrained
   -  Close and lock doors
   -  Tape keys down

-  Instrument

   -  Remove eyepiece
   -  Remove bumpers and pusher hardware
   -  Remove air connection
   -  Tape over any exposed holes (from cables, etc)
   -  Secure any loose cables
   -  Shrink wrap the instrument
   -  Install solar blanked over shrink wrap

-  Cart and Rigging

   -  Verify all cart hardware is in-hand
   -  Verify two wire harnesses are in hand

Rig Onto Cart
-------------

-  Lower table legs onto the casters by turning the 16 leveling bolts,
   and remove the metal pads

-  Roll the instrument away from the telescope

-  Assemble the cart around the instrument

   -  **CAUTION:** be careful to not bump the legs with the cart

-  Ensure that the 8 large bolts on the cart are snug but not tight

-  Attach the lifting wire-harness to each side of the cart

-  Attach the load spreader with straight extensions to the crane,
   using a crane scale

   *The load spreader attached to the crane for lifting the cart*

-  Place the load spreader in the center position (the cart is
   symmetric)

-  Lift the load spreader, and position it over the instrument

-  Being careful to not bump the instrument, lower the load spreader
   and attach the lifting harness D rings. Use 3x shackles to extend the
   length to reach the cart on the floor.

   *Lifting harnesses attached with shackle extensions*

-  Position a person at each corner of the cart

   **CAUTION:** Do not allow the cart to bump the legs or the table
   uncontrolled

-  Slowly lift the cart (**320 lbs**) until it is touching the bottom
   of the table

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_tofrom_table.jpg

   *The cart being lifted to the bottom of the table.*

-  Install the 4 bolts attaching the cart to the table.  Use only the 4 outboard bolts. Loosen bolts
   on the cart as needed to adjust.

-  Once the cart is bolted to the table bottom, while **320 lbs** is
   still on the crane, tighten all cart bolts. Do not over-tighten, make
   1/4 turn after the washers are no longer free. This is to avoid
   excessive stress on the table.

-  Install the triangle stabilizing ropes between the crane hook and

-  Reposition the load spreader center to the instrument + cart
   position marked on it.

   the lifting fixture IAW the below figure. Tighten, but do not cause
   them to pick the load.

   .. image:: figures/stabilizers.jpg

   *The triangle stabilizing ropes should be tight, but not become the
   lifting point for the load.*

-  Ensure that there is room to move the legs out from under the
   table towards the telescope.

-  Position a person at each end of the cart to stabilize it during
   the lift.

-  Position two people to remove the legs from under the table

-  Lift the table off the legs.

-  Move the legs out from under the table.

   .. image:: figures/cart_lift_legs_ready.jpg

   *The cart and instrument ready to be set down on the wheels, with
   legs out of the way.*

-  Set the cart down on its wheels.

-  Move MagAO-X onto the elevator, and remove from the dome

-  When cart is on concrete outside Clay, move very slowly to avoid
   excessive vibration

Transport MagAO-X To The Clean room
-----------------------------------

-  Ensure that the lift gate at the summit has been adjusted for slow
   smooth operation as is done for the asm

-  Push MagAO-X onto the lift-gate

-  Raise the lift-gate to the height of the flatbed truck

-  Move MagAO-X onto the truck, using the come-along

   .. image:: figures/inst_backed_up.jpg

   *MagAO-X is loaded at the telescope using the lift gate,
   adjusted for slow operation.*

-  Secure the instrument by strapping the cart down at 4 points as
   illustrated in the below figure.

   .. image:: figures/inst_on_truck.jpg

   *MagAO-X will be strapped to the Isuzu.*

-  Slowly drive the truck to the cleanroom

-  Back the flatbed truck up to the lift gate.

-  Next, using the come-along, carefully move MagAO-X onto the lift
   gate.

-  Return to the top with the flatbed and move
   the legs to the cleanroom.

-  Placed on 2 dollies as in the below image.

   .. image:: figures/legs_dollies.png

   *Legs on 2 dollies placed in the middle of the table under each lower long tie bar (away from basket).*


-  Move the legs to the flatbed and strap them down.

   *Legs strapped to the truck.*

Transport Electronics
---------------------

-  remove the earthquake bar

-  Move the rack to the lift gate, and load it on the pickup.

-  place foam between the rack side and the truck to protect cable
   connectors

   .. image:: figures/rack_connectors.jpg

   *The electronics rack has many delicate connectors on the side.*

-  strap the rack securely to the truck

   .. image:: figures/electronics_pickup.jpg

   *The rack on a truck for transport.*


-  drive the truck to the cleanroom

-  unload the rack using the lift gate

Remove AOC from Control Room
----------------------------

-  power down AOC

-  remove monitors and pack

-  move AOC to cleanroom.
